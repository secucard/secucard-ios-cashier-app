# Cashier App Sample for iOS
A Cashier sample app for using the [SecucardConnectClientLib](https://github.com/secucard/secucard-connect-objc-client-lib). This sample app is written in Swift.

To get it running follow these steps

1. Clone repository and cd into the repository folder
2. Type ```pod install``` (be sure to have installed cocoapods)
3. After the pods are installed, open the ```CashierApp.xcworkspace``` as [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) tells you to do

As long as the [SecucardConnectClientLib](https://github.com/secucard/secucard-connect-objc-client-lib) for iOS, which is a cocoapods dependency for this project, is in development stage, all pods are tracked in this repository to ensure the app is executable. Otherwise this project would not be able not fetch this dependency.
